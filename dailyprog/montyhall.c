/* Reddit Daily Programm Challenge #141 [Easy] - Monty Hall Simulation
 *
 * This program simulates the famous Monty Hall Problem (description from Wikipedia):
 * 	Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors:
 * 	Behind one door is a car; behind others, goats. You pick a door, say No.1, and the host,
 * 	who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He 
 * 	then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch
 * 	your choice?
 *
 * It runs a user specified number of simulations given one of two choices:
 * choosing not to change doors and choosing to change doors, and displays a success rate for each.
